                                <p>I created a playful design to appeal to the young age demographic the game was aimed at. I used things such as the blue sky and clouds that would be remeniscent of toy story to attract and retain the users.</p>

                                <p>The animation was created to bring a sense of playfulness and make the site interactive. What's more playful than bubbles?</p>

                                        <p>In this project I worked in a team to build a booking system for a hotel.

The purpose for this was to make an easier experience for management that are regulary overwhelmed with the amount of cancelling, adding and editing of bookngs. Working with MongoDB and Alan AI allowed me to develop my backend skills while also experimenting with new web technologies.</p>

                                        <p>This was my first try at creating a landing page using illustrator. I tied into the themes of the games, including important landmarks as it would help tie the website and the game together.</p>

                                        <p>Creating wireframes is part of the development of a website. It is important to catch the clients vision and translate that into what will be the end product. Wireframes allows developers to see what the feel will be like, and allow for better judgement on colour aschemes, composition and copywriting. There is often many different mockups and wireframes are likely to change in the early stages.</p>

                                        <p>I enjoy being creative and working on different media forms such as: film, photography and editing. Here is a project I created for my coursework that allowed me to explore these interests. The intent was to create content that could market an artist to an audience.
                                        In order to create this project I used my pre-existing photography and filming skills to create an article and music video for the artist Beauty Queen. This is where I put my photoshop and premier pro knowledge to use.</p>

                                        <p>A little about my UX experience...I wrote my first analysis as part of a University exam where I analysed Whisk and Things's website. I created detailed personnas that this website may have been targetting, as well as, what their first impression would have been. As we know, the attention span of users is limited when it comes to websites and they make a decision whether to stay on a website or not in 5 seconds,this is important to understand when testing a websites usability.</p>
