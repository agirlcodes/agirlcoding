                                <p>In this project I worked in a team to build a hotel website to showcase a booking system, which is integrated with Alan AI. The purpose for this was to make an easier experience for management that are regulary overwhelmed with the amount of cancelling, adding and editing bookngs.</p>
                                    <p>This project works with MongoDB Realm and Alan AI. The crud operations do not work with the Alan AI but try it out. The script flows well. <br><i>Disclaimer: this website is not mobile friendly</i></p>

                                <p>A little about my UX experience...I wrote my first analysis as part of a University exam where I analysed Whisk and Things's website. I created detailed personnas that this website may have been targetting, as well as, what their first impression would have been. As we know, the attention span of users is limited when it comes to websites and they make a decision whether to stay on a website or not in 5 seconds,this is important to understand when testing a websites usability.</p>

                                            <p>I enjoy being creative and working on different media forms, here is a project I created for my coursework. The intent was to create content that could market an artist to an audience.
                                            In order to create this project I used my photography and filming skills to create an article and music video for the artist Beauty Queen. This is where I put my photoshop and Adobe premier pro knowledge to use.</p>
